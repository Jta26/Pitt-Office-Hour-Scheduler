<!-- EXAMPLE 
Use these as small snippets of code that are imported in parent 
files using the `include` statment like:
<!php include 'header.php';?>

Do not include script tags to components here here, put them in
the parent at the bottom of the body (ensures all interactable elements have been loaded by the 
browser due to top-to-bottom rendering)
